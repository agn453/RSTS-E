Followup: I created a patch that implements the "wake up when the queue goes
not-full".  Or more precisely, it wakes up the process whenever an ack is
received; that covers the probem case and probably doesn't create many other
wakeups since the program is unlikely to be sleeping otherwise.

The attached patch script does the job.  This is for RSTS V10.1.  I will take a
look at RSTS 9.6; the patch is unlikely to apply there (offsets probably don't
match) but the concept will apply there too.  I don't have other DECnet/E
versions, let alone source listings which is what's needed to create the patch.

With this patch, you can run at full emulation speed, with the default queue
limit (5).  In fact, I would recommend setting that limit; if you make the
queue limit significantly larger, the patch doesn't help and things are still
slow.  I suspect that comes from overrunning the queue limits at the receiving
end.  (Note that DECnet/E leaves the flow control choice to the application,
and most use "no" flow control, i.e., on/off only which isn't effective if the
sender can overrun the buffer pool of the receiver.)

To apply the patch, give it to ONLPAT and select the monitor SIL (just <CR>
will give  you the installed one).  Or you can do it with the PATCH option at
boot time, in that case enter the information manually.  The manual will spell
this out some more, I expect.

I have no idea if this issue can appear on real PDP-11 systems.  Possibly, if
you have a fast CPU, a fast network (Ethernet) and enough latency to make the
issue visible (more than a few milliseconds but way under a second).  In any
case, it's unlikely to hurt, and it clearly helps a great deal in emulated
systems.
